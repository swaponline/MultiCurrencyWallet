Key improvements: TDD Anchor sections correctly removed from test-writing tasks (7, 8). testing.md added to Context Files for tasks 7, 8. Wave values corrected to numeric (4). Dependency chains validated and correct. Task descriptions are clear and actionable. Feature batch is ready for agent execution."
