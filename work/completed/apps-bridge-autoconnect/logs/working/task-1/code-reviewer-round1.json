  "notes": "Trivial single-line boolean flag change. No logic changes, no side effects. The isSwapWalletAppsBridge flag remains true for explicit bridge detection. Change aligns with tech-spec Decision 2 rationale and is consistent with industry practice (wallet bridges typically set isMetaMask: true for compatibility). No issues found."
