      "finding": "The `script.async = false` assignment is unnecessary for dynamically inserted scripts that need synchronous loading. When a script is dynamically created and appended via `document.head.appendChild()`, the browser's default behavior is to load it asynchronously. Setting `async = false` makes the script load in insertion order (blocking subsequent dynamic scripts, but not blocking the parser). However, since this is the only dynamically inserted script and it's the intended behavior (block React until bridge loads), this is correct. The task hints say 'Dynamically inserted scripts are always async — no need to set script.async explicitly' but setting async=false actually changes behavior: it makes the script execute in order relative to other dynamic scripts and before DOMContentLoaded. Since we want the bridge client to load before React, keeping `async = false` is the correct choice.",
      "action": "no_change",
      "reason": "The setting is intentional and correct for ensuring bridge loads before React. The implementation hint in the task spec was slightly misleading."

      "finding": "The `new URL(referrer).origin` could return 'null' string for some URL schemes (e.g., data: or blob: URLs). This is an extreme edge case that won't happen with normal document.referrer values from http/https origins.",
      "action": "no_change",
      "reason": "Referrer from iframe parent will always be http/https. The 'null' origin edge case is not applicable in this context."

  "summary": "Clean, minimal implementation that satisfies all acceptance criteria. The script is properly positioned in <head> before React bundles, uses IIFE to avoid global scope pollution, handles referrer parsing with try-catch, and has proper fallback. Build verified successful. No blocking issues found."
