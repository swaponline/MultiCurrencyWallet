Bridge suppression check is correctly placed after all hooks (React rules compliant), uses optional chaining for safety, and the early return null pattern is idiomatic React. Type extension in react-app-env.d.ts is the correct place for global type augmentation. Tests cover all required scenarios with proper mocking.",
