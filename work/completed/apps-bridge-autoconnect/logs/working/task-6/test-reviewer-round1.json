  "summary": "Test suite covers all acceptance criteria with 6 meaningful tests. Tests verify event listener setup/cleanup, activation behavior when active/inactive, bridge mode guard, and handler reference integrity. Mocking strategy is appropriate — hooks and connectors are mocked at module level, window.ethereum is controlled per test.",

      "description": "Test 'does NOT set up bridgeReady listener when window.ethereum is undefined' only verifies no error is thrown. Could additionally verify that activate is never called. However, with no ethereum provider there's no way to trigger bridgeReady, so the test is sufficient as-is.",
