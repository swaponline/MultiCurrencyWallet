  "summary": "Implementation is solid and follows the tech-spec closely. The failover interceptor correctly ports the web apiLooper pattern. Code is well-structured with clear separation: ApiConfig (data), EndpointHealthTracker (state), ApiFailoverInterceptor (behavior), NetworkClient (factory). Minor improvements suggested below.",

      "finding": "getNextHealthyEndpoint and getFirstHealthyEndpoint have identical implementations. getNextHealthyEndpoint has an unused parameter suppressed with @Suppress annotation.",

      "finding": "Thread.sleep() is used for retry delay on the interceptor thread. Acceptable for OkHttp interceptors since they run on background threads.",

      "finding": "NetworkClient had both @Inject constructor and a @Provides in module, creating double-provision.",

    }
  ],
  "spec_compliance": "Implementation matches tech-spec requirements: round-robin failover, 500ms queuing, in-memory health tracking, HTTPS-only validation, private IP blocking."
