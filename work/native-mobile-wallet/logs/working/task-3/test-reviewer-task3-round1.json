  "summary": "All 22 tests pass. All 6 required TDD anchor tests from the task specification are present and correctly implemented. Tests use meaningful assertions that test actual storage behavior, not just mock returns. Edge cases (partial keys, empty values, corruption on all getters) are well covered. Test structure follows Arrange-Act-Assert pattern with clear, descriptive names."
