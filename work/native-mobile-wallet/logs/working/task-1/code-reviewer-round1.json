      "description": "JitPack content filter includes com.walletconnect.* group which overlaps with Maven Central. WalletConnect main artifacts (android-core, sign) are on Maven Central. The JitPack filter should only catch transitive dependencies (com.walletconnect.Scarlet.*). Current filter works but causes redundant lookups.",
      "recommendation": "Narrow JitPack filter to com\\.walletconnect\\.Scarlet\\..* instead of com\\.walletconnect\\..*. Low priority — only affects build resolution speed, not correctness."

      "description": "The gradlew script is a manually written approximation of the standard Gradle wrapper script. It lacks DEFAULT_JVM_OPTS, GRADLE_OPTS handling, and proper argument quoting. This may cause issues with custom JVM args or Gradle opts.",
      "recommendation": "Consider regenerating via 'gradle wrapper' command in CI or replacing with the canonical gradlew from a Gradle 8.5 distribution. Low priority — the script works for basic builds."

  "summary": "Android project scaffold is well-structured. 9 modules properly defined with appropriate dependency separation. BouncyCastle resolution strategy is correct. Two low-severity findings, no blockers."
