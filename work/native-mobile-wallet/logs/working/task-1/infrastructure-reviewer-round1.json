      "description": "CI workflow creates a dummy google-services.json inline. If the JSON format changes or Firebase plugin requires additional fields, the build will break silently. Consider storing a CI-specific google-services.json as a repository secret or encrypted file.",
      "recommendation": "Acceptable for now. Document as known limitation. When Firebase is properly configured, replace with repository secret."

      "recommendation": "No action needed. CI configuration is appropriate."
    }
  ],
  "summary": "Infrastructure setup is solid. Gradle wrapper, properties, and CI workflow are well-configured. Module structure follows standard Android multi-module patterns. BouncyCastle resolution is clean. One medium finding about inline google-services.json in CI, acceptable for MVP."
