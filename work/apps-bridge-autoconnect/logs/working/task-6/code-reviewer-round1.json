      "description": "The `(window as any).ethereum` cast is used because the project's global Window type doesn't include ethereum. This is consistent with how other files in the codebase handle it (e.g., src/hooks/index.ts line 55 uses `const { ethereum } = window` which works due to web3-react type augmentation). The cast approach is slightly less clean but avoids modifying global types.",

      "description": "Dependency array includes [active, activate]. This means the listener is re-registered whenever `active` changes, which is intentional — it ensures the closure captures the latest `active` value. The `activate` function is stable from web3-react context so it won't cause unnecessary re-runs.",
