  "summary": "Both tasks (11, 12) have critical frontmatter issues: wave field must be numeric, not string. Template strictly requires 'wave' to be a number >= 1. Current values 'Final' and 'final' are invalid. All other sections comply with template structure and content requirements. No AC/TDD carry-forward issues detected. Tasks are logically atomic and dependencies are correctly declared.",
