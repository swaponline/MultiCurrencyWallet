## How we get revenue

- By selling [Wordpress plugin](https://codecanyon.net/item/multicurrency-crypto-wallet-and-exchange-widgets-for-wordpress/23532064) (whitelabel, wallet as a service)
- By custom MultiCurrencyWallet integrations
- By [community donations](/docs/DONATE.md)

## Initial selling strategy
- swaponline team can sell SWAP tokens not less than 1 USD per 1 SWAP (please don't buy tokens above 1 usd anywhere to prevent getting rekt)
- By default, funds are used to support liquidity (not the price increase!) but can be managed by CEO 

## Tokenomics (in Roadmap)

At this time SWAP token is just a "securities" that guarantees you part of revenue and access to governance. In the future SWAP, tokens will also use as collateral as a guarantee of the correct behavior of counterparties. For example there are situations when the user will not be able to change funds due to the harmful behavior of the market maker, this guaranteed contribution helps prevent multiple cases:

- MM declines too many requests
- MM accepts request but not deposits crypto
- MM doesn't send crypto in [Turbo swaps](https://github.com/swaponline/MultiCurrencyWallet/blob/master/docs/TURBO_SWAPS.md) exchange
