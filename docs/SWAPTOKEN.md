## How we get revenue

- By selling [Wordpress plugin](https://codecanyon.net/item/multicurrency-crypto-wallet-and-exchange-widgets-for-wordpress/23532064) (whitelabel, wallet as a service)
- By custom MultiCurrencyWallet integrations
- By [community donations](/docs/DONATIONS.md)

## Strategy and roadmap

- ✔️ BTC-ETH atomic swap – done
- ✔️ BTC-ERC20 atomic swap – done
- 👷 UTXO to UTXO atomic swap – soon
- 👷 DeFi on bitcoin (A [Hashed Time-Locked Collateral Contract](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0197.mediawiki) (HTLCC) consists of two scripts that permit a designated party (the "borrower") to lock funds on the Bitcoin chain for a specified amount of time as collateral in a debt agreement where the loan principal is denominated in a currency on another blockchain)
